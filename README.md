GraphQL service with Micronaut

## Introduction
GraphQL provides a rich and dynamic query language to make our API more versatile.

## Why Micronaut?
Micronaut is a lightweight, cloud focused Java framework. 

## What about Spring boot?
GraphQL can work with spring and there are numerous demos available to set up GraphQL with spring. However once set up, use this demo to learn more about GraphQL as most of the concepts are framework agnostic.

## Which library are we using for GraphQL and Java?
I am using SPQR which gives us a fast way of working with GraphQL in Java. It follows a code first approach which helps in staticly typed languages like Java.
